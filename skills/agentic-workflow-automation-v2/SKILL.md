# Agentic Workflow Automation

## Overview

Build workflow blueprints that can be translated into automation platforms such as n8n or internal orchestrators.


```yaml
# Example workflow blueprint
name: document-processor
trigger:
  type: webhook
  url: /api/documents
actions:
  - name: extract-text
    type: transformation
  - name: summarize
    type: ai-agent
```



## When to Use

- Agent workflow blueprints

## Workflow

1. Define workflow name, trigger, and ordered steps.
2. Normalize each step into a simple execution contract.
3. Build a blueprint with dependencies and execution order.
4. Export JSON/markdown artifacts for implementation.

## Use Bundled Resources

- Run `scripts/generate_workflow_blueprint.py` for deterministic workflow output.
- Read `references/workflow-blueprint-guide.md` for step design guidance.

## Guardrails

- Keep each step single-purpose.
- Include clear fallback behavior for failed steps.

## Tools
## Tools

## Examples

```bash
# Example usage
skill --help
```


### CLI Commands

```bash
# Common commands
skill --help
skill --list
```

### API Usage

```python
# Example usage
result = skill.process(input_data)
```



## Performance

### Optimization Tips

- Use caching where applicable to reduce repeated computations
- Consider batch processing for multiple operations
- Implement async/parallel processing when possible
- Monitor memory usage for large datasets

### Best Practices

- Profile before optimizing
- Use appropriate data structures for the task
- Consider lazy loading for large resources


## Dependencies

### Required

- Python 3.8+ or Node.js 16+ (depending on skill type)
- See skill metadata for specific requirements

### Optional

- Additional dependencies may be needed for extended features
- Check official documentation for full requirements


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Command not found
- Solution: Ensure the skill is properly installed

**Issue**: Permission denied
- Solution: Check file permissions and user access

**Issue**: Configuration error
- Solution: Verify config.yaml syntax and paths

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable verbose output
skill run --verbose --debug

# Check logs
tail -f /var/log/skill.log
```


## Architecture

### Components

1. **Core Module** - Main processing logic
2. **CLI Interface** - Command-line interaction
3. **Configuration Manager** - Settings handling
4. **Logger** - Event tracking and debugging

### Data Flow

```
Input → Validator → Processor → Formatter → Output
```


## Features

### Core Features

- Feature 1: Description of what this capability does
- Feature 2: Another important capability
- Feature 3: Additional functionality

### Advanced Features

- Advanced option A for power users
- Advanced option B for customization


## Installation

```bash
pip install {skill_dir}
```

For development:

```bash
pip install -e .
```


## Limitations

- May require specific environment configuration
- Performance may vary based on input size
- Some features require optional dependencies
