此 Skill 已安装到 `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/skills/skill-vetter/`

1. 查看 SKILL.md 了解详细用法
2. 如有 scripts/run.sh，可直接运行
3. 参照 Examples 章节中的命令进行操作

### 适用场景

- 请参考 ## When to Use 章节
- 如有疑问，请查看 ## Troubleshooting 章节

### 快速开始

```bash
# 查看帮助
cd /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/skills/skill-vetter
cat SKILL.md

# 运行（如有脚本）
./scripts/run.sh
```

### 注意事项

- 请确保已安装所需依赖
- 建议先阅读 ## Setup 或 ## Installation 章节
- 详细配置说明见 ## Configuration 章节

Security-first vetting protocol for AI agent skills. **Never install a skill without vetting it first.**

## When to Use

- Before installing any skill from ClawdHub
- Before running skills from GitHub repos
- When evaluating skills shared by other agents
- Anytime you're asked to install unknown code

## Vetting Protocol

### Step 1: Source Check

```
Questions to answer:
- [ ] Where did this skill come from?
- [ ] Is the author known/reputable?
- [ ] How many downloads/stars does it have?
- [ ] When was it last updated?
- [ ] Are there reviews from other agents?
```

### Step 2: Code Review (MANDATORY)

Read ALL files in the skill. Check for these **RED FLAGS**:

```
🚨 REJECT IMMEDIATELY IF YOU SEE:
─────────────────────────────────────────
• curl/wget to unknown URLs
• Sends data to external servers
• Requests credentials/tokens/API keys
• Reads ~/.ssh, ~/.aws, ~/.config without clear reason
• Accesses MEMORY.md, USER.md, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md
• Uses base64 decode on anything
• Uses eval() or exec() with external input
• Modifies system files outside workspace
• Installs packages without listing them
• Network calls to IPs instead of domains
• Obfuscated code (compressed, encoded, minified)
• Requests elevated/sudo permissions
• Accesses browser cookies/sessions
• Touches credential files
─────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Step 3: Permission Scope

```
Evaluate:
- [ ] What files does it need to read?
- [ ] What files does it need to write?
- [ ] What commands does it run?
- [ ] Does it need network access? To where?
- [ ] Is the scope minimal for its stated purpose?
```

### Step 4: Risk Classification

| Risk Level | Examples | Action |
|------------|----------|--------|
| 🟢 LOW | Notes, weather, formatting | Basic review, install OK |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | File ops, browser, APIs | Full code review required |
| 🔴 HIGH | Credentials, trading, system | Human approval required |
| ⛔ EXTREME | Security configs, root access | Do NOT install |

## Output Format

After vetting, produce this report:

```
SKILL VETTING REPORT
═══════════════════════════════════════
Skill: [name]
Source: [ClawdHub / GitHub / other]
Author: [username]
Version: [version]
───────────────────────────────────────
METRICS:
• Downloads/Stars: [count]
• Last Updated: [date]
• Files Reviewed: [count]
───────────────────────────────────────
RED FLAGS: [None / List them]

PERMISSIONS NEEDED:
• Files: [list or "None"]
• Network: [list or "None"]  
• Commands: [list or "None"]
───────────────────────────────────────
RISK LEVEL: [🟢 LOW / 🟡 MEDIUM / 🔴 HIGH / ⛔ EXTREME]

VERDICT: [✅ SAFE TO INSTALL / ⚠️ INSTALL WITH CAUTION / ❌ DO NOT INSTALL]

NOTES: [Any observations]
═══════════════════════════════════════
```

## Quick Vet Commands

For GitHub-hosted skills:
```bash
# Check repo stats
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO" | jq '{stars: .stargazers_count, forks: .forks_count, updated: .updated_at}'

# List skill files
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/contents/skills/SKILL_NAME" | jq '.[].name'

# Fetch and review SKILL.md
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWNER/REPO/main/skills/SKILL_NAME/SKILL.md"
```

## Trust Hierarchy

1. **Official OpenClaw skills** → Lower scrutiny (still review)
2. **High-star repos (1000+)** → Moderate scrutiny
3. **Known authors** → Moderate scrutiny
4. **New/unknown sources** → Maximum scrutiny
5. **Skills requesting credentials** → Human approval always

## Remember

- No skill is worth compromising security
- When in doubt, don't install
- Ask your human for high-risk decisions
- Document what you vet for future reference

## Tools
## Tools

## Examples

```bash
# Example usage
skill --help
```


### CLI Commands

```bash
# Common commands
skill --help
skill --list
```

### API Usage

```python
# Example usage
result = skill.process(input_data)
```



## Performance

### Optimization Tips

- Use caching where applicable to reduce repeated computations
- Consider batch processing for multiple operations
- Implement async/parallel processing when possible
- Monitor memory usage for large datasets

### Best Practices

- Profile before optimizing
- Use appropriate data structures for the task
- Consider lazy loading for large resources


## Dependencies

### Required

- Python 3.8+ or Node.js 16+ (depending on skill type)
- See skill metadata for specific requirements

### Optional

- Additional dependencies may be needed for extended features
- Check official documentation for full requirements


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Command not found
- Solution: Ensure the skill is properly installed

**Issue**: Permission denied
- Solution: Check file permissions and user access

**Issue**: Configuration error
- Solution: Verify config.yaml syntax and paths

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable verbose output
skill run --verbose --debug

# Check logs
tail -f /var/log/skill.log
```


## Architecture

### Components

1. **Core Module** - Main processing logic
2. **CLI Interface** - Command-line interaction
3. **Configuration Manager** - Settings handling
4. **Logger** - Event tracking and debugging

### Data Flow
